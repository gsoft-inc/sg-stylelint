# sg-stylelint

[![NPM Status](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sharegate/stylelint-config-recommended.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sharegate/stylelint-config-recommended)

ShareGate shared [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) config.

## Installation

Install the recommended stylelint configuration packages.

With NPM:

```bash
npm i -D stylelint @sharegate/stylelint-config-recommended
```

Then, create a file called `stylelint.config.js` at the root of your project and add the following configurations:

```javascript
/** @type {import('stylelint').Config} */
module.exports = {
    extends: "@sharegate/stylelint-config-recommended"
};
```

### VSCode

Install the [stylelint extension for VSCode]("https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hex-ci.stylelint-plus"). The extension will provide Just In Time linting while typing in VSCode and code autofixing.

To enable stylelint autofix **on save**, add the following configuration to your VSCode project settings:

```javascript
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": true,
        "source.organizeImports": false /* Can be turned on */
    },
    "json.format.enable": false,
    "stylelint.autoFixOnSave": true
}
```

This is also strongly recommended that you had a `.prettierignore` file at the root of your project with `*` as content to prevent any conflict between stylelint and Prettier for user who have the Prettier VSCode extension installed:

```javascript
// .prettierignore
*.css
*.less
*.saas

// or if you want to ignore all files
*
```

You might wonder why Prettier is not the favorite tool anymore to autofix CSS code... We used to format CSS with Prettier because [stylelint autofixing](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/cli#autofixing-errors) was not very good. Recently it have greatly improved and most rules now support autofix. 

It also comes with a few benefits:

- No more weak integration between Prettier and stylelint.
- All stylelint linting rules can now be validated on the CI.

## Maintainers

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-stylelint.git
```

Then, install the dependencies with Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Release

**Process**

Updates of this configuration package should batch multiple changes. Most of stylelint rules are stylistics and doesn't have an impact on the success of a project. On the other hand, frequent changes of those rules might cause friction and be a burden for the teams.

Adding a new rule or updating an existing one can generate a lot of modifications to the code of an existing project. To ensure that the authors of the projects who consume those configuration packages understand the impact of updating a package, every release of a package **should be a major increment to the version number**.

Every release should also contain a **release notes** that includes the new or updated rules and how to disabled / revert them manually in the consumer project when possible.

**Do the actual release**

Before you release, make sure you have **write access** for all the NPM packages that will be published and that you are [logged in to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/logging-in-to-an-npm-enterprise-registry-from-the-command-line).

To release, open a terminal at the root project of the workspace and execute the following:

```bash
yarn release
```
